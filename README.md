# star-galaxy-classification
Final project for the DLDIA class (TaipeiTech, Autumn Semester, 2022). The project is dedicated to the star-vs-galaxy classification task (see here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/dummy-astronomy-data).

## Quick start
1. Install the required packages: tensorflow and its dependencies, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (see requirements.txt, but note that they were generated for the Mac M2; for other systems this file may need appropriate editing).
2. Download the dataset from the link above, place the "CutoutFiles" folder in the root directory of the project.
3. Run the /src/experiment.py file. The results will be saved to the "all_results.csv" file in the /src/ folder.
